			At the dinner party were Lady Winslow, Doctor Marcolla, Countess Contee, Madam Natsiou, and Baroness Finch.
		</p>
		<p>
			The women sat in a row. They all wore different colors and [character] wore a jaunty [color] hat.
			[character] was at the far left, next to the guest wearing a [color] jacket. The lady in [color] sat left of
			someone in [color]. I remember that [color] outfit because the woman spilled her [drink] all over it. The
			traveler from [city] was dressed entirely in [color]. When one of the dinner guests bragged about her
			[heirloom], the woman next to her said they were finer in [city], where she lived.
		</p>
		<p>
			So [character] showed off a prized [heirloom], at which the lady from [city] scoffed, saying it was no match
			for her [heirloom]. Someone else carried a valuable [heirloom] and when she saw it, the visitor from [city]
			next to her almost spilled her neighbor's [drink]. [character] raised her [drink] in toast. The lady from
			[city], full of [drink], jumped up onto the table falling onto the guest in the center seat, spilling the
			poor woman's [drink]. Then [character] captivated them all with a story about her wild youth in [city].
		</p>
		<p>
			In the morning there were four heirlooms under the table: [heirloom], [heirloom], [heirloom], and
			[heirloom].
		</p>
		<p>
			But who owned each?
